    <!-- <p>
      MRS. MARCHMONT. Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?
      <br />

      LADY BASILDON. I suppose so. Are you?
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I go
      anywhere.
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. I come here to be educated.
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Ah! I hate being educated!
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the commercial
      classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that
      I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come here to try to find
      one.
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] I don’t see
      anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The
      man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. How very trivial of him!
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. About myself.
