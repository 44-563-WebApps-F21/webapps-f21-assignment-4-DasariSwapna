      MRS. MARCHMONT. Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?
      <br />

      LADY BASILDON. I suppose so. Are you?
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I go
      anywhere.
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. I come here to be educated.
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Ah! I hate being educated!
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the commercial
      classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that
      I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come here to try to find
      one.
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] I don’t see
      anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The
      man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. How very trivial of him!
      <br />
      LADY BASILDON. Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?
      <br />
      MRS. MARCHMONT. About myself.
      <br />

    <p>
      Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret? Yes. Horribly tedious
      parties they give, don’t they? I come here to be educated. So do I. It
      puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it? But
      dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some
      serious purpose in life. So I come here to try to find one.How very
      trivial of him! About myself.Not in the smallest degree.And how well it
      becomes us, Olivia! Our husbands never appreciate anything in us. We have
      to go to others for that! That is exactly what we can’t stand. My Reginald
      is quite hopelessly faultless. He is really unendurably so, at times!
      There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him. My poor
      Olivia! We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.
      Oh, dear no! They are as happy as possible! And as for trusting us, it is
      tragic how much they trust us.

      [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] [_Languidly_.] [_Shaking her
      head_.][_Rising_.][_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]
      [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
      riband and star of the Garter_. _A fine Whig type_. _Rather like a
      portrait by Lawrence_.][_Smiling_.][_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.][MABEL
      CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_, _the
      apple-blossom type_. _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a flower_.
      _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and the little
      mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the mouth of a
      child_. _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the astonishing
      courage of innocence_. _To sane people she is not reminiscent of any work
      of art_. _But she is really like a Tanagra statuette_, _and would be
      rather annoyed if she were told so_.] [_Looking at her with a kindly
      twinkle in his eyes_.] You are a very charming young lady!
